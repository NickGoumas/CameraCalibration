Following the OpenCV Camera Calibration tutorial found here: http://opencv-python-tutroals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/py_tutorials/py_calib3d/py_calibration/py_calibration.html

I'm currently interested in the intrinsic calibration values so I may neglect rotation and translation vectors in my code/comments a bit. The script is fairly straightforward but I may do a small writeup here in the near future.
